# Welcome to 4PR: Developers Creating Real Projects

This project is for developers who are tired of the traditional job interview process, especially the endless DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions that don't align with real-world development. Instead of spending time on algorithms that don’t contribute to our everyday work, we believe developers should focus on building **real projects** that solve actual problems and generate profit. This is how new companies are born.

## The Problem

The current job market is frustrating. Developers often find themselves stuck in interviews where they are asked irrelevant algorithmic questions instead of being tested on practical skills. Many of us feel that **the true value we bring isn’t reflected in these interviews**. So why not skip the endless job search and create something ourselves?

Building a product, however, comes with its own challenges:
- **Funding and resources**: You need money to keep the lights on while you work on your product.
- **Business validation**: You need to ensure your idea has a real market before diving in.
- **Execution**: Turning an idea into a successful product is not easy. There are many hurdles along the way.

That’s why we need to **take action together**, create products, and build something of real value.

## The 4PR Vision

4PR is about **developers coming together to create products** rather than waiting for opportunities in the traditional job market. We want to:
- Build products that are actually useful.
- Skip the irrelevant DSA interview process and focus on real-world challenges.
- Start small, create profit, and eventually form companies that are led by developers.

## How You Can Contribute

If you’re frustrated with the interview process or just want to break out of the cycle of endless job applications, this is the place for you. We want to create products together, and we need developers like you to:
- Validate business ideas and work on real projects.
- Contribute to discussions on product development and scaling.
- Help turn ideas into profitable products that could eventually form new companies.
